<h2 class="pane-head">About</h2>
<p>
<span class="emph-text">Flora-2</span>&nbsp;
(a.k.a. <span class="emph-text">Ergo Lite</span>)
is an advanced object-oriented
knowledge representation and reasoning
system. It is a dialect of F-logic with
numerous extensions, including meta-programming in the style of HiLog,
logical updates in the style of Transaction Logic, and defeasible reasoning.
<!--
Flora-2 was designed with
extensibility and flexibility in mind, and it provides strong support for
modular software design through its unique feature of dynamic modules.
-->
Applications include intelligent agents, Semantic Web,
knowledge-based networking, ontology management, integration of information,
security policy analysis, and more.
</p>
<p>
Flora-2 comes with comprehensive <a
href="documentation.html">manuals</a> and a
<a href="tutorial.html">tutorials</a>, which provide an overview of
the theoretical foundations as well as 
the system. The tutorials include
many examples and exercises.
</p>
<p>
  All matters concerning Flora-2 and related systems are discussed in 
  <a href="https://groups.google.com/a/coherentknowledge.com/forum/#!forum/ergoai-flora2-xsb-forum"
  target="new_window">this forum</a>.
</p>

<!--
<p>
  Flora-2 relies on the <a href="http://xsb.sourceforge.net"
  target="new_window2">XSB inference engine</a>, which must be installed in
  order to run Flora-2.

   A new maintenance release: <span class="emph-text">Flora-2/Ergo Lite 1.2.1
   </span>
   is here.
   This release fixes a number of bugs and also packs a few new things thanks
   to the continuing support from
   <a href="http://www.coherentknowledge.com/" target="new_window">Coherent Knowledge</a> and
   <a href="https://www.sri.com" target="new_window">SRI International</a>.
   See 
   <a href="release_notes.html" target="new_window">release notes</a> for the
   details of the changes.
  On the <span class="emph-text">Ergo</span> front, expect a final release of
   version 1.2 soon (with additional data connectors, explanation API,
   ErgoText, and more). Coherent continues to
   offer a free 90 day trial license
  of <a href="http://www.coherentknowledge.com/" target="new_window">Ergo Suite</a>

<p>
   <span class="news-date">June 14, 2017:&nbsp;</span>
   <a href="http://www.coherentknowledge.com">Coherent Knowledge</a>
   has released two tutorials on <span class="emph-text">Ergo</span>,
   which should be very useful also to Flora-2 users, especially at the beginner
   level.
   The <a href="https://sites.google.com/a/coherentknowledge.com/ergo-suite-tutorial/home">Ergo Suite</a> tutorial is a gentle
   introduction to mostly basic, but also some more advanced,
   features of Ergo. Much of this material is applicable to Flora-2.
   The tutorial <a href="https://sites.google.com/a/coherentknowledge.com/tutorial-capturing-real-world-knowledge/home">Capturing Real
   World Knowledge in Ergo</a> explains the process of development of a
   knowledge base for a real world domain (the laws from <em>California
   Driver's Handbook</em>). It also uses only the basic features, and almost
   all of it applies to Flora-2.
</p>
<p>
   <span class="news-date">March 28, 2017:&nbsp;</span>
   Finally, a new release of <span class="emph-text">Flora-2/Ergo Lite: 1.2
   (Monstera deliciosa)</span>!
   A large number of bugs were fixed in this release
   and quite a few enhancements added -- many due to the support
   from <a href="http://www.coherentknowledge.com/" target="new_window">Coherent Knowledge</a> and
   <a href="https://www.sri.com" target="new_window">SRI International</a>.
   See 
   <a href="release_notes.html" target="new_window">release notes</a> for the
   details of the changes.
<br/> 
  On the <span class="emph-text">Ergo</span> front, its 1.2 release is also imminent, but meanwhile
  a free 90 day trial version
  of <a href="http://www.coherentknowledge.com/" target="new_window">Ergo Suite 1.2 (Solon)
  beta</a> is available.
</p>
<p>
   <span class="news-date">August 9, 2015:&nbsp;</span>
   Flora-2 now has a commercial cousin,
   <span class="emph-text">
     <a href="http://coherentknowledge.com/product-overview-ergo-suite-platform/"
      target="new_window">Ergo
   Suite</a></span> from 
   <a href="http://coherentknowledge.com/"
      target="new_window">Coherent Knowledge Systems</a>.
   Compared to Flora-2,
   Ergo Suite provides more expressiveness, enhanced connectivity, better
      performance, and enterprise features. See
   <a href="http://coherentknowledge.com/comparison-of-ergo-suite-to-flora-2/"
      target="new_window">Ergo Suite vs. Flora-2</a> for more details.
   This announcement celebrates the
   release of Flora-2 v.1.1 (Loquat).
   See 
   <a href="release_notes.html" target="new_window">release notes</a> for the
   information on the changes in Loquat. Needless to say, Ergo Lite remains
   free as in "freedom" and no functionality has been taken away.  Although
   Ergo Suite has much additional functionality, it is syntactically upward
   compatible with Ergo Lite: Flora-2's rules and queries work the same way when
   run under Ergo Suite.  From now on, Flora-2 will be also officially known as
   "Ergo Lite" to emphasize  both that
   Flora-2 includes only a subset of Ergo Suite's
   functionality and also the fact that
   Flora-2's development is led by the same
   people that developed Ergo Suite. Coherent Knowledge, ever since
   its founding, supports the Flora-2 effort and contributes greatly to its
   ongoing maintenance.
