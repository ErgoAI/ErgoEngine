<h2 class="pane-head">About this tutorial</h2>
<p>
  This is a 3-day tutorial with the following approximate <a
  href="tutorial/schedule.txt">schedule.</a>
  We assume a reasonably good understanding of the Prolog language
  and some knowledge of Deductive Databases (see preliminary reading below).
  The tutorial consists of two main parts:
  <ul>
    <li>
      <i>Part 1: Foundations.</i>
      Covers the basics of F-logic, HiLog, Transaction Logic, top-down
      execution strategy, and tabling
      <br/>
      <a href="tutorial/part1-foundations.ppt">Powerpoint version</a>
    </li>
    <li>
      <i>Part 2: Programming in Flora-2.</i> Covers the main parts of the
      Flora-2 environment and
      shows how the foundational concepts described in Part 1 of the tutorial
      are embodied in a concrete knowledge-base programming language
      <br/>
      <a href="tutorial/part2-programming.ppt">Powerpoint version</a>
    </li>
  </ul>
</p>
The PowerPoint slides are best viewed using Office XP or later.
Although the slides are in Powerpoint, they can be viewed quite well
using <a href="http://www.openoffice.org/">OpenOffice</a> 2.0 or later.
<p>
Part 2 of the tutorial uses a large number of little examples that illustrate
various subtle points of Flora-2. These examples are found <a
href="tutorial/examples/">here</a>; they are referred to on the slides.
</p>
<p>
  The tutorial includes three homeworks and additional "fun" problems. The
  homeworks are found <a href="tutorial/homeworks/">here</a>.
</p>

<p>
If you prefer, 
the entire tutorial can be downloaded in <a href="tutorial.tar">one tar
archive</a>, including the slides, exercises, and solutions.
