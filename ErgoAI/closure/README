    Note: all .flh files in this directory are generated from the
    corresponding .fli files by the Makefile at the time Flora is
    built. This is done by the predicate flWrapAround/1 defined
    in flrwraparound.P.
    The .flh files are cleaned up by the "clean" target of the makefile.

   The closure/ directory contains pieces of the trailer included in every
   program or loaded on demand.
   
   The actual trailer is assembled in includes/flrtrailer.flh out of the
   pieces that live in the current directory.

   The different pieces of the trailer are as follows:

flrcommon.fli - the common part of all trailers
flrcommon_inh.fli - the common part of all trailers that use inheritance
flreqltrailer.fli - part of the trailers that use equality and no inheritance
flreqltrailer_inh.fli - part of the trailers that use equality and inheritance
flrnoeqltrailer.fli - part of the trailers with neither equality nor inheritance
flrnoeqltrailer_inh.fli - part of the trailers with no equality but with
			    inheritance 
flrscalareql.fli - part of the trailers that implements the special F-logic
		    equality axiom
flrpredeql.fli - part of the trailer that implements the equality axiom for
		    HiLog predicates
flrprednoeql.fli - part of the trailer that is used for predicates when
		    equality is not maintained
