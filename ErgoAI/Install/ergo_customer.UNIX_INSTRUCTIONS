Run ErgoAI/Install/ergo_customer.sh
in a directory that has both a link to ErgoAI, XSB, and contains
       ergoStudio.jar
       runErgoAI.exe
       runErgoAI.sh

This will create ergoAI.run in that directory.

To install, move ergoAI.run to where you want it to be installed and
type
        ergoAI.run

The installation will be in a subdirectory Coherent

Running ErgoAI:
      ./Coherent/runErgoAI.sh

Running ErgoAI with no GUI:
      ./Coherent/ErgoAI/runergo
