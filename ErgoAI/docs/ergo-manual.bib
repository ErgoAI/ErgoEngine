OPTabstract="InterProlog is the first Prolog-Java interface to support multiple Prolog systems through the same API; currently XSB and SWI Prolog, with GNU Prolog and YAP under development --- on Windows, Linux and Mac OS X. It promotes coarse-grained integration between logic and object-oriented layers, by providing the ability to bidirectionally map any class data structure to a Prolog term; integration is done either through the Java Native Interface or TCP/IP sockets. It is proposed as a first step towards a common standard Java + Prolog API, gifting the Java developer with the best inference engines, and the logic programmer with simple access to the mainstream object-oriented platform.",
