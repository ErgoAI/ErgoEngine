Release Notes
=============

ErgoAI 1.3 (Zeno)
================

This release addresses a number of stability issues and also introduces
additional features and extensions. See the ErgoAI Reasoner and
Packages manuals and tutorials for more information. Updated manuals and
tutorials can be accessed from the ErgoAI Documentation page on the
Coherent Knowledge website. Â The new features are listed below.

1. The new "set" and "map" data types.
   The new standard module \set provides set and map data structures. The
   set structure is an unordered collection of items that supports fast
   search and set operations. The map structure supports key-based
   retrieval, like dictionaries in Python, maps in Java, and associative
   arrays in Perl. Extension of \in and \subset to sets. 
2. The new data structure for numeric and symbolic ranges (e.g., 2..9) with
   the operator \in extended to this structure.
3. A new data type \currency, for financial applications.
   E.g., "USD 223"^^\currency.
4. Enhancements in the explanations API.
   It is now possible to get information about the rule used in each
   derivation step, including its English formulation, if provided.
5. Enhancements in import of tabular data.
   Imported data can now be accessed via frames, not only via
   predicates. This can be much more convenient for spreadsheets that
   contain many columns including in order to easily select a few columns
   of interest from a large, multi-column spreadsheet . Meta-information
   (column names) are also now properly imported.
6. Improved debugging features in the Java API.
   The showOutput() and enableLogging() methods allow one to see the warnings
   and errors reported by the Ergo compiler during runtime. They also show the
   output produced by the Ergo subprocess. New methods hasErrors() and
   hasWarnings() allow one to check if a previous interaction with the
   knowledge base had any errors or warnings.
