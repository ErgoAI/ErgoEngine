\section{\fl and \FLSYSTEM by Example}\label{sec-byexample}

In the future, this section will present a number of 
introductory examples illustrating the use of \fl and \FLSYSTEM. In
addition, the
reader can consult the \ERGO tutorials
available on the Coherent Web site: \url{https://sites.google.com/a/coherentknowledge.com/ergo-suite-tutorial/}
and
{\small\url{https://sites.google.com/a/coherentknowledge.com/tutorial-capturing-real-world-knowledge/}}.
\\
The Ergo Example Bank on the same site,
{\small\url{https://sites.google.com/a/coherentknowledge.com/ergo-suite-tutorial/example-bank-of-advanced-uses}},
provides a number of advanced examples, many dealing with importing
information from external sources.

Another source of examples and background material is the \FLORA tutorial,
which is found at
\url{http://flora.sourceforge.net/tutorial.html}.
