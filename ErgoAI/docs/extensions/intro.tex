\section{Introduction}\label{sec-intro}

\ERGOAI is a software suite that contains \ERGOAI Reasoner
(often called \ERGO reasoner or just \ERGO),
\ERGOAI Studio, and various packages that connect the reasoner to
external software (e.g., databases), languages (Java, Python),
or formats (like JSON, RDF, XML, etc.).
This manual describes the \ERGO reasoner.
Manuals and tutorials describing all parts of \ERGOAI
can be found at \url{http://coherentknowledge.com/ergo-documentation/}.


The Coherent \FLSYSTEM reasoner
is a sophisticated object-based  knowledge representation and
reasoning platform. It is based on decades of research into logic rules
systems and it presents a unified language of \fl
\cite{KLW95}, HiLog \cite{hilog-jlp}, Transaction Logic
\cite{trans-chapter-98,trans-tcs94}, and defeasible reasoning
\cite{lpda-iclp-09}.

\FLSYSTEM is based on the open-source \FLORA inference system,\footnote{
  \url{http://flora.sourceforge.net}
}
also known as \ERGOLITE,
%% 
but is much more scalable and it extends \ERGOLITE in numerous ways that
are crucial for enterprise use.
These extensions and enhancements are proprietary to Coherent Knowledge
Systems.

The present document is based on the \FLORA manual\footnote{
  \url{http://flora.sourceforge.net/docs/floraManual.pdf}
  }
but is adapted for Coherent needs and expanded with
\ERGO-specific information.
