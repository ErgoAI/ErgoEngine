For backward compatibility with Flora-2,
  \FLSYSTEM will also try to compile and load files with the \texttt{.flr}
  extension, such as \texttt{program.flr}. However, if there are both
  \texttt{program.ergo} and \texttt{program.flr} then \texttt{program.flr}
  is ignored unless the \texttt{.flr} extension is \emph{explicitly}
  mentioned. For instance, if the command \texttt{load\{'program.flr'\}}
  is executed, then \texttt{program.flr} will be taken even if
  \texttt{program.ergo} exists. On the other hand,
  \texttt{load\{program\}} (without an explicit extension)
  will try to load \texttt{program.ergo}
  first. If this file does not exist, \texttt{program.flr} will be tried.
  If that file is not found, \texttt{program.P} will be attempted followed by
  \texttt{program.xwam}.
