    Emacs major mode for Ergo
    ===================================

Put ergo.elc in a directory that is on the load path of Emacs.
The easiest way is to have a separate directory for emacs libraries.
A directory can be added to emacs search path by putting the following in
the file ~/.emacs:

(setq load-path (cons "your-directory" load-path))

Next tell Emacs which files are Flora-2 or Ergo files, so it would
invoke the appropriate major mode automatically:

   (setq auto-mode-alist
       (cons '("\\(\\.flr$\\|\\.ergo$\\|\\.ergotxt$\\)" . ergo-mode)
             auto-mode-alist))
   (autoload 'ergo-mode "ergo" "Major mode for editing Ergo knowledge bases." t)
