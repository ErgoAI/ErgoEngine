ErgoSPARQL Tool information:

Step 1: Enter/edit the SPARQL endpoint, user credentials, IRI prefixes, and a query.

Step 2: Select the output format: the fastload syntax or the native Ergo syntax. The default option is the fastload format, which supports quick loading of large data sets into Ergo. This is done using the "fastload{file,storage_container}" command; querying is done via the "fastquery{module,query}" command. The native Ergo syntax is much less scalable and is recommended only for demonstrations.

Step 3: Change the output predicate name (called, node, by default), if needed.
Note: whether you select the fastload or the Ergo format, the output will be a set of facts of the form
node(arg1,arg2,arg3,...).
The main difference between the formats is in how the IRI prefixes are specified.

Step 4: Click on the "Query SPARQL endpoint" to send a query to the endpoint. You will be asked to chose an output file. Next, the "Status" label will be showing "Querying SPARQL endpoint ..." until the result is retrieved and saved.

Step 5: Once the query terminates, the output is placed in the Ergo content text area on the right side of the screen and the system is now ready for the next query.
