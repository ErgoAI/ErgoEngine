Ergo RDF/OWL Tool information:

Step 1: Select the desired input type radio buttons and then select the input file. Once you select a file the "Input file name" label will show the input file. 
Note: if n-quads is selected as the input type then n-triples are tolerated in the input file. In that case, the output graph name entered below will be used. If none entered, "main" will be used as the default graph name.

Step 2: Select the output predicate type: n-quads or n-triples, where n-triples is the default option. If the output is in the form of n-quads then the graph name  can also be specified. The default for the graph name is "main".

Step 3: Select the output format: the fastload syntax or the native Ergo predicate or frame syntaxes. The default option is the fastload format, which supports quick loading of large data sets into Ergo. This is done using the "fastload{file,storage_container}" command; querying is done via the "fastquery{module,query}" command. The native Ergo syntax (whether predicates or frames) is much less scalable and is recommended only for demonstrations.

Step 4: Edit the default IRI prefixes, if necessary.

Step 5: Click on "Import RDF/OWL" to invoke the translator and generate a result. The "Status" label will be showing "Loading file ..." until the result of the translation becomes available. The translator creates the result in the directory of the original input file under the name "originalFileName.P" (for the fastload format) or "originalFileName.ergo" (for the native Ergo format).

Step 6: Once the translation process completes, the latest translated file is put in the OWL and Ergo content text areas on the right area of the screen and the system is now ready to import another RDF/OWL file.
