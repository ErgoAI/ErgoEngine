   This module contains various calls that can change XSB and FLORA-2
   flags that are set for debugging purposes.

%% MK: test_mode/1: support for testing. Need something more general, like
%% catch. But catch does not work in  a usual way, as delayed literals
%% are slipped from under catch/3, so catch/3 applies vacuously to when/2.
:- dynamic test_mode/1.
:- export set_test_mode/1, clear_test_mode/1, clear_test_mode/0.
:- export has_test_mode/1.

set_test_mode(Mode) :- assert(test_mode(Mode)).

clear_test_mode(Mode) :- retractall(test_mode(Mode)). 
has_test_mode(Mode) :- test_mode(Mode).


%% Change the default behavior of abolishing tables
%% This is used to work around an XSB bug.

	set_prolog_flag(table_gc_action,abolish_tables_singly).
set_abolish_tables_flag(default) :-
