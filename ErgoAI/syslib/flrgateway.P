/*
   These bridge rules are needed because of the various design and
   implementation bugs in XSB, which make it hard to reliably predict
   what the various symbols mean and in which XSB module they belong.
   Flora-2 compiler should avoid generating symbols that belong to
   XSB modules (I.e., module:predicate). Instead, it should generate
   the usermod predicates/function symbols defined here (in usermod).
