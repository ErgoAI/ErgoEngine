The demo
../../ergo_demos/evidential_probability/bikes.ergo
can be used as an example (perhaps other examples to come).

The file that uses evidential probability (like bikes.ergo)
should expect to invoke evidential probability in module \ep.

Probabilistic data must be in the 4-ary predicate named \pct.
If the module containing \pct(?,?,?,?) is encapsulated then this predicate
must be exported in addition to whatever the user wants to export:

:- export{\pct(?,?,?,?)}.

Do not include the above statement if the module holding \pct is not
encapsulated.

Next: load the user program containing probabilistic data. For instance,

ergo> [bikes].

To pose a probabilistic query, use something like this:

?- ep(TargetClass,Class,?LowProb,?HighProb)@\ep.

?- ep(stolen,redRacingDomestic,?L,?H)@\ep.

?L = 0
?H = 0.0506
