++Warning[Ergo]> File: lt4.flr, line: 95
		 Subgoal: (\naf (r(?A,?B), (\naf ?B < 0)))
		 Unbound variables: [?B]
		 The subgoal has unbound variables under \naf or 'forall'.
		 Ergo is unlikely to evaluate this to true or false.
		 Try to bind free & quantified variables to finite domains.
		 If everything is correct, this warning can be suppressed with
		    setruntime{unsafe_naf(ignore)} or
		    setruntime{unsafe_naf(ignoreonce)}.
