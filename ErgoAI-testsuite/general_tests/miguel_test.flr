2. represent the regulation that:  a given company's aggregate amount

3. represent more of the sufficient conditions that imply an affiliate

4. more test queries; start with specifying associated objectives for the tests
   - show interesting cases of crossing threshold due to larger amount that
     implies prohibitedness
   - exercise the 20% rule (2.) above.  
   - in comments, describe in English tersely the justification for prohibition,

/* Definition of Covered Transaction. Under section 223.3(h) of Regulation W, a covered transaction includes: 
•An extension of credit to an affiliate; 
•A purchase of, or investment in, a security issued by an affiliate; 
•A purchase of an asset from an affiliate, including an asset subject to recourse or an agreement to repurchase; 
•The acceptance of a security issued by an affiliate as collateral for an extension of credit to any person or company; and 
•The issuance of a guarantee [See Footnote 6], acceptance, or letter of credit, including: an 
endorsement or standby letter of credit, on behalf of an affiliate [See Footnote 7]; a confirmation of a 
letter of credit issued by an affiliate; and a cross-affiliate netting arrangement. */
